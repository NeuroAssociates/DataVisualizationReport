# For better data visualization

There are a number of JavaScript web technologies for data visualization in the world. Depending on which of these technologies you use, the effort, results, and impact of creating the visualization can vary greatly.

As a data visualization specialist, we have compared and analyzed the Javascript Web libraries for data visualization. In this process, the internship members who worked together with Kookmin University played a direct role. The results of these individual analyzes can be found on the following pages.
